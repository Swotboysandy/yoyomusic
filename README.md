# 🎵 YoYoMusic

Ever wanted to vibe with friends to music like it’s a live radio station?  
**YoYoMusic** is a collaborative music experience where anyone can hop in, queue songs, and vote to play or stop them — together.  
No DJs. No controllers. Just community vibes.

## 🚀 What is YoYoMusic?

YoYoMusic is like a live music room. Think of it as a **community-powered jukebox**:
- Everyone can join
- Everyone can queue songs
- Songs play when **the majority votes yes**
- Songs stop when **enough people vote no**

No skipping without a squad. It’s fair. It’s fun. And yeah, a little chaotic sometimes.
